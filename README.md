# 🏦 ATM Booth Simulation using OOP in Python

Welcome to the **ATM Booth Simulation** repository! This project simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system, implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. It showcases how to handle user account data, transactions, and basic banking operations in a clean, modular way.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project includes an ATM system where a user can:

- 🔐 **Check Account Balance**
- 💵 **Withdraw Money**
- 💰 **Deposit Money**
- 🧾 **View Transaction History**
- 🚪 **Exit the ATM Booth**

The code is structured using **OOP concepts**, with each feature encapsulated in classes and methods, making it easy to extend or modify the program.

## 💡 Features

- **Account Management**: Users can check their current balance.
- **Withdrawal & Deposit**: Users can withdraw and deposit money from/to their account.
- **Transaction History**: Track all transactions (withdrawals and deposits).
- **Secure Design**: Basic PIN authentication for accessing ATM features.
- **Object-Oriented Approach**: The project is built entirely using OOP, featuring classes like `ATM`, `Account`, and `Transaction`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **OOP Principles** (Classes, Objects, Methods, Encapsulation)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-booth-oop-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd atm-booth-oop-python
   ```

3. Run the `atm.py` file to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python atm.py
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works

- **Account Class**: Handles the account's balance and transaction history.
- **ATM Class**: Manages the ATM functionalities like withdraw, deposit, and balance inquiry.
- **Main Function**: Acts as the interface, prompting the user for input and interacting with the `ATM` and `Account` objects.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- **Understand OOP Concepts**: Learn how to structure your code using OOP with real-world applications.
- **Modularity**: Get familiar with writing modular code by breaking down the system into multiple classes.
- **ATM Simulation**: Build a practical project simulating real-world ATM functionalities.
